## Jawly Xpress (Online Shipping Application)

Back then, many people experienced delivering goods problems, such as wrong addresses, lost goods, and errors in calculating shipping costs. To address these issues, we began by understanding the problem through user feedback and research. These helped us to identify the features needed and design a suitable database. Afterward, we started to develop an application named Jawly Xpress. This application has several features that allow users to submit pick-up requests, track package deliveries, view delivery histories, and calculate estimated shipping costs.

Notes: 
1. Before running the application, don't forget to import the database from the Jawly_Database.sql file.
2. In the Form.cs window, modify the SQL server, uid, pwd, and database to your configuration, as shown in the following screenshot.

3. Run the application and use the stored account (_username: tokobahagia_, _password: apaajalah5_).
